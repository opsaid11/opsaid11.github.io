Usually, the main project tree is stored in a local or remote repository, to which access is configured for project participants. When making changes to the project content, the version control system allows you to fix them, combine changes made by different project participants, roll back to any earlier version of the project, if required.\nIn classical version control systems, a centralized model is used, assuming a single repository for storing files. Most version control functions are performed by a special server. The project participant (user) receives the version of files he needs before starting work through certain commands. After making changes, the user places the new version in the repository. At the same time, previous versions are not deleted from the central repository and you can return to them at any time. The server can not to save the full version of the modified files, but to perform a so—called delta compression - to save only changes between successive versions, which reduces the amount of data stored.\nVersion control systems support the ability to track and resolve conflicts that may arise when several people are working on a single file. You can merge (merge) changes made by different participants (automatically or manually), manually select the desired version, cancel the changes altogether or lock files for modification. Depending on the settings, the lock is not allows other users to get a working copy or prevents changing the working copy of the file by means of the OS file system, thus providing privileged access to only one user working with the file.\nVersion control systems can also provide additional, more flexible functionality. For example, they can support working with multiple versions of a single file, keeping a common history of changes up to the point of branching versions and their own change histories of each branch. In addition, it is usually available information about which of the participants, when and what changes were made. Usually this kind of information is stored in the change log, access to which can be restricted. Unlike the classical ones, in distributed version control systems, a central repository is not mandatory.\nAmong the classic VCS, the most famous are CVS, Subversion, and among the distributed ones — Git, Bazaar, Mercurial. The principles of their work are similar, they differ mainly in the syntax of the commands used in the work.\n##Git Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.\nGit is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows. The system is designed as a set of programs specially designed for their use in scenarios. This makes it convenient to create specialized version control systems based on Git or user interfaces. For example, Cogito is just such an example of a wrapper to Git repositories, and StGit uses Git to manage a collection of fixes (patches).\nGit supports rapid separation and merging of versions, includes tools for visualization and navigation through the non-linear development history. Like Darcs, BitKeeper, Mercurial, Bazaar and Monotone, Git provides each developer with a local copy of the entire development history, changes are copied from one repository to another.\nRemote access to Git repositories is provided by a git daemon, SSH or HTTP server. The TCP git-daemon service is included in the Git distribution and is, along with SSH, the most common and reliable access method. The HTTP access method, despite a number of restrictions, is very popular in controlled networks, because it allows you to use existing network filter configurations.\n","date":1651881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651881600,"objectID":"06eb82f8ea244fe7a3ee31e5aaae0bcb","permalink":"https://example.com/post/git_post/","publishdate":"2022-05-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/git_post/","section":"post","summary":"git version control","tags":["Academic"],"title":"git","type":"post"},{"authors":["Stepanov Ivan"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Overview my last week went very well, every day I was engaged in learning how to cook pasta carbonara\nIngredients it needs the following ingredients\n 3 cups uncooked pasta 6 bacon strips, diced 2 garlic cloves, minced 1-1/4 cups milk 1 package (8 ounces) cream cheese, cubed 1/2 cup butter, cubed 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese  Overview basically, you can cook the pasta yourself, so let’s go back to my last week.I was at home all week, except Tuesday, that day I went to physical education. the rest of the days I slept, ate, took a break from studying and people. thank you for your attention\n","date":1651881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651881600,"objectID":"e11d754bc04627982164569163f77789","permalink":"https://example.com/post/lastweek/","publishdate":"2022-05-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/lastweek/","section":"post","summary":"this post is dedicated to my last week","tags":["Academic"],"title":"my last week","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
